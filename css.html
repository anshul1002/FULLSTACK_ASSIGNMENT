            <h2>Basic Grammar:</h2>
            <p>English grammar may seem complex, but with practice, you'll grasp its fundamental rules. Here are some key grammar points to get you started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sentence Structure: English sentences typically follow a subject-verb-object order. For example, "I (subject) love (verb) learning English (object)."</li>
                <li>Verb Tenses: English verbs change to indicate the time of action. Common tenses include present, past, and future. For example, "I eat (present tense) breakfast every morning."</li>
                <li>Articles: English uses definite (the) and indefinite (a/an) articles to specify nouns. For example, "I have a dog."</li>
                <li>Plurals: Most English nouns form their plurals by adding "-s" or "-es." For example, "cat" becomes "cats," and "box" becomes "boxes."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Practice constructing simple sentences and paying attention to verb conjugations and noun forms.</p>
        </section>
